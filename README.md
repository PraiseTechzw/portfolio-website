My Portfolio Website
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. It showcases my professional portfolio, projects, and skills.

Getting Started
To run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the website.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API Routes
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/\*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Font Optimization
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
